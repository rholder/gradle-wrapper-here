## What is this?
What if you could just extract the Gradle wrapper files into the project
directory without ever running Gradle or even having it installed? Well now you
can do that with `gradle-wrapper-here`.

I like the [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/5.6.2/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html),
but I think it's silly to have to have an actual installation of Gradle on your
machine to bootstrap from before you can start using it for the first time on a
project. If you've never used Gradle before, I believe this is a much quicker
mechanism to getting a working Gradle installation set up for a project.

## Installation
### macOS & Linux
Drop the latest version of `gradle-wrapper-here` into your $PATH and set it executable:

```bash
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/gradle-wrapper-here -L https://github.com/rholder/gradle-wrapper-here/releases/download/v0.8.0/gradle-wrapper-here && \
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gradle-wrapper-here
```

## Usage
There isn't really much to this project. It extracts a copy of the Gradle
wrapper out into the specified directory, as in:
```bash
mkdir koala
gradle-wrapper-here koala
```
If you prefer to extract the wrapper to the current directory you're in, you
can use:
```bash
gradle-wrapper-here ./
```
Now you should have `gradlew` and some other goodies in your project directory.
Run the following to verify it's working:
```bash
./gradlew -version
```
If you haven't ever used the Gradle wrapper before, it will download and unpack
a version of Gradle into a well-known location for the current user. Running
`./gradlew` again won't redownload it.
